# Beans Plan [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/metzgore/BeansPlan.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/metzgore/BeansPlan)

**Beans Plan** is an Android app which downloads and shows the weekly schedule of the online streaming station [Rocketbeans TV](https://www.rocketbeans.tv/).
The schedule data is used from the official RBTV api. You can find the docs here: [here](<https://github.com/rocketbeans/rbtv-apidoc>).
You can add reminders for future shows so you never miss a live show again.
